"""Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for manipuland tool responses.

This module contains serializable datatypes for structured tool responses with
JSON serialization support. Classes use primitive types (str, float, int, bool)
rather than domain-specific types to enable clean JSON serialization.

## Architectural Pattern: Domain Models vs Response DTOs

This follows the same separation as furniture agents:

1. **Domain Models** (in `agent_utils/`):
   - Use rich domain types (UniqueID, RigidTransform, PlacementInfo, Path)
   - Example: SceneObject with placement_info

2. **Response DTOs** (this file):
   - Use primitive types for JSON serialization
   - Example: ManipulandInfo with separate position/rotation fields

## Conversion Pattern

Tools convert domain models to DTOs when returning responses:
- Domain model: PlacementInfo → Position2D + rotation_2d fields
- Domain model: SupportSurface → SupportSurfaceInfo
- Domain model: SceneObject → ManipulandInfo
